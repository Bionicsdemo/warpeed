## RUNWAY ML GEN-3

### Video 1: CubeSat Solar Panel Deployment

**Prompt:**
```
A 6U CubeSat satellite deploying its solar panels in low Earth orbit. Camera slowly orbits around the satellite. Four blue photovoltaic panels unfold symmetrically from the metallic silver body. Earth's curved blue atmosphere visible in background with orbital sunrise creating dramatic golden rim lighting. Panels deploy in 3 seconds with smooth mechanical precision. Ultra-realistic space photography, 8K quality, cinematic lighting. Camera movement: slow orbital dolly 360 degrees around subject.
```

## OPTIMIZATION FOR WEB

### Video Compression Settings

```bash
# Using FFmpeg
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset slow -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4

# For background videos (higher compression)
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -preset slow -vf scale=1280:720 output.mp4
```

### Recommended Formats
- **Primary:** MP4 (H.264) - Best compatibility
- **Fallback:** WebM (VP9) - Better compression for modern browsers
- **Poster Frame:** JPG (for preview before video loads)
