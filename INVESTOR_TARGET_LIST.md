## üìß EMAIL TEMPLATE (COLD OUTREACH)

**Subject:** Quantum-optimized lightsail achieves 0.50c - IBM Torino validated

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I'm Heinz Jungbluth, founder of Warpeed. We've built the world's first quantum-optimized lightsail propulsion system, validated on IBM's 133-qubit Torino processor.

**Key results:**
- 0.50c velocity (2.5√ó faster than Breakthrough Starshot)
- $13B total mission cost (vs Starshot's $500B)
- 8 years to Œ± Centauri (vs 21.8 years)
- 85.87% manufacturability confirmed across 512,000 configurations

**Near-term revenue:** $300M by Year 5 from:
- Satellite deorbiting systems ($50M market)
- Quantum materials licensing (Boeing, Airbus, SpaceX)
- Aerospace consulting contracts

**Raising:** $2M seed round
**Use of funds:** 10cm prototype fabrication, NASA NIAC grant, first commercial contracts

Would love 15 minutes to share our quantum optimization breakthrough and how we're making interstellar travel economically feasible.
