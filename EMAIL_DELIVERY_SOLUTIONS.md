# Email Delivery Solutions - Warpeed Authentication System

## Current Status
‚úÖ **EmailJS is working correctly** - Emails are being sent (Status 200)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Problem**: Emails are going to SPAM folder

## Why This Happens
EmailJS (free plan) uses shared email servers without proper domain authentication:
- No SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records for your domain
- No DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) signatures
- No DMARC policy
- Shared IP reputation with other EmailJS users

## Solutions (Ranked by Priority)

### üöÄ Option 1: Upgrade to EmailJS Private Email (Easiest)
**Cost**: $15-30/month
**Setup Time**: 5 minutes
**Spam Reduction**: 70-80%

**Steps:**
1. Go to EmailJS Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Email Services
2. Upgrade to "Private Email" plan
3. Add custom email (e.g., noreply@warpeed.space)
4. Verify your domain with EmailJS

**Pros:**
- Quick setup
- No coding changes needed
- Better deliverability

**Cons:**
- Monthly cost
- Still limited control over infrastructure

### üî• Option 2: AWS SES (Simple Email Service) - RECOMMENDED
**Cost**: $0.10 per 1,000 emails (almost free)
**Setup Time**: 30-60 minutes
**Spam Reduction**: 95%+

**Why AWS SES:**
- Industry standard for transactional emails
- Full SPF/DKIM/DMARC support
- Excellent deliverability
- Very low cost
- Professional solution

**Setup Steps:**
1. **Create AWS Account**
   - Go to aws.amazon.com
   - Sign up for free tier

2. **Configure AWS SES**
   - Navigate to Amazon SES console
   - Verify your domain (warpeed.space)
   - Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records in your DNS
   - Request production access (moves you out of sandbox)

3. **Get SES SMTP Credentials**
   - Create SMTP credentials in SES console
   - Note: SMTP endpoint, username, password

4. **Update Your Code**
   - Replace EmailJS with nodemailer + AWS SES SMTP
   - Use backend (Node.js/Python) to send emails securely

**Code Example (Node.js Backend):**
```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.AWS_SES_SMTP_USER,
    pass: process.env.AWS_SES_SMTP_PASSWORD
  }
});

async function sendVerificationEmail(name, email, code) {
  await transporter.sendMail({
    from: 'Warpeed Technologies <noreply@warpeed.space>',
    to: email,
    subject: 'Your Verification Code - Warpeed Technologies',
    html: `Your verification code is: ${code}`
  });
}
```

### üíº Option 3: SendGrid (Alternative to AWS SES)
**Cost**: Free tier (100 emails/day), then $19.95/month
**Setup Time**: 30 minutes
**Spam Reduction**: 95%+

**Steps:**
1. Sign up at sendgrid.com
2. Verify your domain
3. Set up authentication (SPF/DKIM)
4. Get API key
5. Use SendGrid API or SMTP

### ‚ö° Option 4: Resend.com (Modern Alternative)
**Cost**: Free tier (3,000 emails/month), then $20/month

  to: email,
  subject: 'Your Verification Code',
  html: `<p>Your code: ${code}</p>`
});
```

- Rate limiting
- Better security
- Professional infrastructure
- Can add database for user management

**Tech Stack Options:**
- **Option A**: Vercel Serverless + Resend
- **Option B**: AWS Lambda + SES
- **Option C**: Railway/Render + Node.js + SES

## DNS Records You'll Need (Example for AWS SES)

Once you choose AWS SES or similar, you'll add these to your domain DNS:

```
SPF Record (TXT):
v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all

DKIM Records (CNAME):
[Generated by AWS SES - you'll get 3 records]

DMARC Record (TXT):
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@warpeed.space
```
