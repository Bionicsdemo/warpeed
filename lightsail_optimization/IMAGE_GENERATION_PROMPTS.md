## PROMPT 6: COMPARACIÓN ANTES/DESPUÉS - CON Y SIN PROTECCIÓN

```
Dramatic split-screen comparison illustration showing two identical lightsails after 8-year interstellar journey, scientific visualization style:

LEFT SIDE - "SIN SISTEMA DE PROTECCIÓN" (WITHOUT PROTECTION):
10m × 10m lightsail in catastrophic condition. Surface heavily cratered and pockmarked from 8×10¹¹ micrometeorite impacts. Large holes and tears (shown as dark voids) where debris penetrated thin reflective layers. HfO₂/SiO₂ layers shattered, golden-blue coating peeling away. Surface reflectivity degraded to patchy appearance - mostly grey-black (damaged areas) with sparse golden-blue patches (surviving areas).

Visible damage: >50 large perforations (1mm-1cm diameter), hundreds of micro-craters, extensive delamination, fragmented edges. Overall reflectivity: ~25% (shown with dim, scattered laser reflection). Structure compromised, sail warped and buckled.

Status indicators (red):
❌ Reflectivity: 25% (vs 98.92% original)
❌ Intact area: 40%
❌ Mission status: FAILED
❌ Survival probability: 20-30%

RIGHT SIDE - "CON SISTEMA DE PROTECCIÓN WARPEED" (WITH PROTECTION):
Same 10m × 10m lightsail in excellent condition. Surface shows minor wear but remains highly reflective. Rainbow iridescence from intact HfO₂/SiO₂ layers. 90 of 100 cells fully functional (golden-blue), 8 cells in self-healing mode (pink-purple polymer active), only 2 cells failed (dark).

Visible protection features: Graphene-reinforced SiC outer shield showing impact scars but intact, self-healing polymer patches (pink-purple honeycomb pattern) actively sealing micro-damage, cell grid boundaries preventing damage propagation. Overall surface maintains mirror-like quality with brilliant laser reflection.

Status indicators (green):
✅ Reflectivity: 92% (vs 98.92% original)
✅ Intact area: 90%
✅ Mission status: SUCCESS
✅ Survival probability: 85-92%

CENTER DIVIDER showing technical comparison table:

| Parámetro | Sin Protección | Con Protección Warpeed |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Masa total | 48 mg/m² | 50 mg/m² (+4%) |
| Reflectividad final | 25% | 92% |
| Celdas funcionales | 30/100 | 90/100 |
| Supervivencia misión | 20-30% | 85-92% |
| Costo adicional | $0 | $30,000 (+0.2%) |
| TRL | 6 | 4-5 |

Background: Deep space with Alpha Centauri visible. Both sails shown at same distance, illuminated by same laser beam to emphasize reflectivity difference - protected sail creates brilliant reflection, unprotected sail barely reflects.

Annotation: "After 8-year journey at 0.5c - Quantum-optimized protection makes the difference between mission success and catastrophic failure"

Style: Scientific comparison visualization, split-screen before/after, photorealistic rendering, dramatic contrast, technical accuracy, professional presentation, NASA/JPL quality, 8K resolution
