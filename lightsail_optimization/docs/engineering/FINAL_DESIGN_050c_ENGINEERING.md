```

**Spectral Response:**

Cable diameter: 100 μm (0.1 mm)
Cable length: 20 cm (Stage 1), scales with area
Cable strength: 50 GPa tensile
Cable mass: 2 mg per cable × 4 = 8 mg total
```

**Load Distribution:**
- Radiation pressure: Uniform across sail
- Maximum stress: At cable attachment points
- Stress concentration factor: 2.0× (with reinforcement)

**Stress Analysis (Stage 1, 500 GW):**

```python
# Radiation pressure
P_rad = P_laser / (c × A)
P_rad = 500e9 / (299792458 × 32) = 52.1 Pa

# Sail radius (circular approximation)
R_sail = sqrt(32/π) = 3.19 m

# Membrane stress
σ = P_rad × R_sail / (2 × t)
σ = 52.1 × 3.19 / (2 × 20e-9)
σ = 4.16 GPa = 4,160 MPa

# Safety factor (vs 20 GPa SiC limit ÷ 2)
SF = 10,000 MPa / 4,160 MPa = 2.4 ✓ SAFE
```

### 1.6 Thermal Analysis

**Heat Load (Stage 1, 500 GW):**

```python
# Absorbed power
P_abs = P_laser × α = 500e9 × 0.0005 = 250 MW

# Radiative equilibrium (Stefan-Boltzmann)
# P_abs = σ_SB × A × T⁴ × 2  (both sides)

σ_SB = 5.67e-8  # W/(m²·K⁴)
A = 32 m²

T⁴ = P_abs / (σ_SB × A × 2)
T⁴ = 250e6 / (5.67e-8 × 32 × 2)
T⁴ = 6.89e13

T = (6.89e13)^0.25 = 1,627 K
```

**Temperature Margin:**
```
Operating: 1,627 K
Limit:     2,758 K (HfO₂ melting)
Margin:    1,131 K (41% safety margin) ✓ SAFE

θ = 1.30e-7 radians = 0.027 arcseconds

# Beam radius at distance d:
r(d) = r₀ + θ × d

# At 1000 km (end of acceleration zone):
r(1000 km) = 5 m + 1.30e-7 × 1e6 m = 135 m

# Beam area increases:
A_initial = π × 5² = 78.5 m²
A_1000km = π × 135² = 57,256 m²
Area ratio = 730×

# Power density drops:
I_initial = 500 GW / 78.5 m² = 6.37 GW/m²
I_1000km = 500 GW / 57,256 m² = 8.73 MW/m²

# Effective divergence factor (averaged):
divergence_factor ≈ 0.10 (10% of initial power)
```

**This matches our quantum optimization assumptions ✓**

- Timeline: 2030-2035 (post-infrastructure)

**Option 3: Nonprofit Conversion**
- Transfer to international foundation
- Model: CERN, ESA structure
- Timeline: After commercial viability proven

**Most Likely: Hybrid**
