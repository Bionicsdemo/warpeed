## QUANTUM STRATEGY

### Why Quantum Computing Can Find Better Configurations

**Classical optimization limitations:**
- Sequential search (even with GPU parallelization)
- Local minima trapping
- Limited parameter space exploration
- Cannot explore quantum superposition states

**Quantum advantages:**
- Explores 2^12 = 4,096 configurations SIMULTANEOUSLY in superposition
- Quantum tunneling escapes local minima
- Interference amplifies optimal solutions
- Natural parallelism at quantum level

### Parameter Encoding (12 Qubits)

```
Qubits 0-2:   Sail Area (8 values)
              [0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64] m²

Qubits 3-5:   Thickness (8 values)
              [10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000] nm

Qubits 6-8:   Laser Power (8 values)
              [100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000] GW

Qubits 9-11:  Number of Stages (8 values)
              [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] stages
```

**Total search space:** 8^4 = 4,096 unique configurations

## MULTI-STAGE CONCEPT

### Why Staging Enables >0.15c

**Single-stage limitation:**
```
m_total = m_sail + m_payload
As velocity increases, all mass continues accelerating
Power requirements scale linearly with mass
```

**Multi-stage advantage:**
```
Stage 1: Large sail + all subsequent stages
         Reaches 0.05c, then drops Stage 1

Stage 2: Medium sail + remaining stages
         Continues from 0.05c → 0.12c, drops Stage 2

Stage 3: Small sail + payload
         Continues from 0.12c → 0.25c+

Each stage reduces mass, increasing acceleration
with same laser power!
```

### Physics of Staging

**Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation (Modified for Lightsails):**

```
Δv = (F/m₀) × t × ln(m₀/m_f)

Where:
F = laser force (constant)
m₀ = initial mass (with all stages)
m_f = final mass (after stage drop)
t = acceleration time per stage

For N stages:
v_total = Σ(i=1 to N) Δv_i
```

**Key insight:** Each stage drop creates a mass ratio >1, enabling exponential velocity gains!

### Real Mass Calculations

**Material: Kapton + HfO₂/SiO₂ (REAL)**

```python
# Mass per m² (calculated from REAL densities)
t_kapton = 5e-6 m
t_hfo2 = 6.3e-6 m
t_sio2 = 9.2e-6 m

ρ_kapton = 1420 kg/m³
ρ_hfo2 = 9680 kg/m³
ρ_sio2 = 2200 kg/m³

mass_per_m2 = (5e-6 × 1420 + 6.3e-6 × 9680 + 9.2e-6 × 2200)
            = 7.1 + 61.0 + 20.2
            = 88.3 mg/m²
```

**Example 3-Stage Configuration:**

```
Stage 1: 16 m² sail = 1,413 mg
Stage 2: 4 m² sail = 353 mg
Stage 3: 1 m² sail = 88 mg
Payload: 1 gram = 1,000 mg
───────────────────────────────
Total: 2,854 mg

Mass ratios:
Stage 1→2: 2854/1441 = 1.98
Stage 2→3: 1441/1088 = 1.32
Stage 3→payload: 1088/1000 = 1.09
```

## EXPECTED QUANTUM RESULTS

### Hypothesis: Optimal Configuration

Based on physics analysis, quantum optimization should discover:

**Predicted optimal (to be verified by IBM Torino):**
```
Sail Area: 8-16 m² (Stage 1)
Thickness: 50-100 nm (balance mass/strength)
Laser Power: 2,000-5,000 GW (aggressive but feasible)
Stages: 4-6 (sweet spot for mass ratio)

Expected velocity: 0.20-0.30c
Time to α Centauri: 15-22 years
```

### Why This Beats Classical Optimization

**Classical optimization found:**
- Single stage designs only
- Conservative power levels (<500 GW)
- v_max = 0.15c

**Quantum can discover:**
- Multi-stage configurations (not obvious to classical)
- Higher power + staging synergy
- Configurations in "quantum gaps" between classical samples

---

## FEASIBILITY CONSTRAINTS (ENFORCED)

All configurations must satisfy:

**1. Thermal Limit (Kapton substrate):**
```
T_max = 673 K (400°C)

P_absorbed = P_laser × α
T = (P_absorbed / (σ × A × 2))^0.25

For α = 0.005 (0.5% absorption):
P_laser < 673^4 × σ × A × 2 / 0.005
```

**2. Stress Limit (Kapton with SF=2.0):**
```
σ_max = 115 MPa (with safety factor)

σ = P_radiation × R_sail / (2 × t)
P_radiation = P_laser / (c × A)

Constraint enforced in objective function
```

**3. Cost Constraint:**
```
Realistic laser power: <10,000 GW
($10 trillion at $1/W)

Configurations with P >10 TW marked as "aspirational"
```

## QUANTUM CIRCUIT DESIGN

### Circuit Structure

```
1. Initialization: H gates on all 12 qubits
   Creates equal superposition of all 4,096 states

2. Variational Ansatz: RealAmplitudes(reps=4)
   - 4 layers of rotation + entanglement
   - 48 parameterized gates total
   - Optimized for parameter search

3. Measurement: All qubits
   Collapses to specific configurations
   Probability ∝ quality of design
```

### Why This Works

**Quantum interference:**
- Bad configurations destructively interfere → low probability
- Good configurations constructively interfere → high probability
- After 4,000 shots, best designs appear most frequently

**Entanglement:**
- Qubit 6-8 (power) entangled with 9-11 (stages)
- Qubit 0-2 (area) entangled with 3-5 (thickness)
- Natural correlations emerge from quantum dynamics

## POST-PROCESSING ANALYSIS

Once IBM Torino completes (ETA: 10-30 minutes with queue):

### Step 1: Extract Top Configurations
```python
# Sort by measurement counts (quantum vote)
top_10 = sorted(results, key=lambda x: x['count'], reverse=True)

# Each has format:
{
  'bitstring': '101011001101',
  'count': 243,  # out of 4000 shots
  'area': 8.0,
  'thickness': 100e-9,
  'power': 2000e9,
  'stages': 5
}
```

### Step 2: Calculate Actual Performance
```python
for config in top_10:
    # Full multi-stage calculation
    v_final = calculate_multistage_velocity(...)

    # Verify constraints
    if feasible:
        print(f"Velocity: {v_final/c:.4f}c")
        print(f"Time to α Cen: {4.37/(v_final/c):.1f} years")
```

### Step 3: Engineering Validation
```python
# Check REAL constraints:
- Temperature < 673 K (Kapton limit)
- Stress < 115 MPa (with safety factor)
- Laser power < 10 TW (economic limit)
- Manufacturing feasibility
```

## BREAKTHROUGH SCENARIOS

### Scenario A: Quantum Finds 0.25c+ Configuration

**If quantum discovers v ≥ 0.25c:**
```
This would be a MAJOR breakthrough!

Possible mechanisms:
1. Optimal 6-8 stage configuration
2. High power (5-10 TW) with perfect staging
3. Novel area/thickness ratio we missed

Impact:
- Time to α Cen: <18 years
- Within single career span
- Changes interstellar exploration viability
```

### Scenario B: Quantum Confirms 0.15-0.20c Limit

**If quantum converges near classical optimum:**
```
Validates our physics understanding

Implications:
- 0.15-0.20c is hard physical limit with current materials
- Need breakthrough in:
  * Laser technology (>1 TW economically)
  * Sail materials (higher T_max)
  * Alternative propulsion (fusion, antimatter)
```

### Scenario C: Quantum Discovers "Sweet Spot"

**If quantum finds unexpected configuration:**
```
Example: 3-stage with specific power/area ratio

Could reveal:
- Non-obvious optimization landscapes
- Synergies between parameters
- "Goldilocks zone" for staging

Value: Even small improvements valuable
0.15c → 0.18c saves ~7 years to α Cen!
```
